    co-founders Craig Underwood’s financial savvy and David Hyun’s deep
    knowledge of real estate development, Red Hook supports charter school
    leaders as they navigate bureaucratic red tape, construction complexity and
    tight timeframes. We’re (literally) invested in seeing you succeed.

  title: About Us
faq:
  groups:
    - answer: >
        Ownership provides autonomy. This means no constraints from the landlord
        or your authorizer.  A school can control its own destiny -- plus, there
        will not be any further rental increases. Further, depending on the cost
        of your acquisition financing, your annual acquisition financing
        repayment may be materially lower than your lease payments. 
      question: Why should a school own its campus?
    - answer: >
        Red Hook specializes in evaluating school campus development.  We
        analyze risk --  including political, landuse and community support --
        when trying to obtain permits to allow a school building on a property.
        We have an excellent track record of getting projects to the finish line
        and we are so confident that we guarantee it: if Red Hook does not get
        final approval for charter school use, a school can walk away from the
        project with no money out of pocket.  We provide 100% of the financing
        -- the school does not pay anything until the property is move-in
        ready.  We pride ourselves in understanding that each school is unique
        and has different needs; we make sure these needs are met through the
        design of the building. 
      question: Why should I team up with Red Hook?
    - answer: >
        Red Hook is led by David Hyun and Craig Underwood. David always has a
        school’s best interests in mind because he was an operator himself. He
        led the Alliance College-Ready Public School as its CFO/COO.  He drove
        in-house development projects as the organization expanded campuses all
        while creating strong reserve funds. Craig has decades of experience
        working in the capital markets, specifically with charter schools. He
        knows the ins and outs of financing a project and knows how to make
        facility ownership affordable for schools. Together, the financing and
        development teams of Red Hook are a one-stop shop. 
      question: Why is Red Hook qualified?
    - answer: >
        Red Hook offers a Lease to Own model.  The model helps schools with
        limited enrollment (often due to space constraints); schools that have
        not received their renewal yet; and schools that have less-than-ideal
        cash reserves. It also helps schools avoid taking the risk of
        pre-development expenses to secure approval to build their campus. That
        risk includes costly out-of-pocket spending, a significant time
        investment, as well as the potential failure to gain approval. Overall,
        the Lease to Own model helps to create an affordable and responsible
        path to facility ownership.  
      question: How does Red Hook help a school own its facility?
    - answer: >
        Charter schools with strong credit (think great FICO score) can directly
        access a variety of permanent financing options.  Schools who are
        younger might not have the necessary longevity to be viewed as credit
        worthy, and thus likely will have a greater difficulty accessing
        traditional financing.  Credit worthiness normally includes a solid
        history of financials, enrollment, and academics to gain favorable
        financing (think low interest rate).

        If a school decides to directly finance a project themselves through
        traditional means like philanthropy, new market tax credits, traditional
        bank loans or municipal bonds, the school will be liable for
        pre-development costs. If a school is unsuccessful in obtaining the
        approval to proceed with the project, the school will have spent
        $200,000-$800,000 of its valuable reserves with nothing to show for it.
        Red Hook takes this risk for the school with no financial commitment
        from the school if Red Hook fails to receive the necessary approvals.
      question: >-
        Why do I need to lease from Red Hook? Why can’t I own my facility from
        the beginning?
    - answer: >
        A school pays nothing until keys are delivered to the property and the
        school can move in. Then, the school makes payments to Red Hook in the
        form of lease payments until the school acquires the property from Red
        Hook.
      question: When does my school start to pay Red Hook?
    - answer: >
        Red Hook clients have access to a number of financing options, including
        traditional bank debt, philanthropic funding,  Community Development
        Financial Institutions (CDFI’s), and the municipal bond market.
