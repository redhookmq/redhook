    Red Hook Capital Partners serves schools that make a powerful impact in
    their communities. We partner with high-quality schools that teach
    underserved students, ELL and students of color, as well as ones that
    provide free and reduced fee lunches, or offer unique aspects to education.


    Red Hook is a special combination of finance and construction. Growing from
    co-founders Craig Underwood’s financial savvy and David Hyun’s deep
    knowledge of real estate development, Red Hook supports charter school
    leaders as they navigate bureaucratic red tape, construction complexity and
    tight timeframes. We’re (literally) invested in seeing you succeed.
