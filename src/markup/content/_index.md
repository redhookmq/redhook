    Red Hook Capital Partners serves schools that make a powerful impact in their communities. We partner with high-quality schools that teach underserved students, ELL and students of color, as well as ones that provide free and reduced fee lunches or offer unique aspects to education. 


    Red Hook is a special combination of finance and construction. Growing from co-founders Craig Underwood’s financial savvy and David Hyun’s deep knowledge of real estate development, Red Hook supports charter school leaders as they navigate bureaucratic red tape, construction complexity and tight timeframes. We’re (literally) invested in seeing you succeed.

        David’s knowledge of charter school real estate development is
        unsurpassed. Since 2009, he has developed and financed over 25 charter
        schools — totaling over $300 million in investment — using conventional
        bank loans, new market tax credits, tax exempt bonds, and various state
        bonds. In two decades, he’s touched all aspects of the real estate
        cycle, from investment to construction and development to property
        management and corporate accounting.


        Prior to joining Red Hook Capital, Mr. Hyun worked for Westfield,
        Trammell Crow Company, Playa Capital Company (Playa Vista Master
        Development), and most recently he served as the CFO/COO at Alliance
