Citizens of the World (CWC) is a national non-profit corporation headquartered in Los Angeles. CWC opened their second location in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Silver Lake in 2012. The school has outperformed both the district and the state, ranking in the top 13% in Math and in the top 14% in English Language Arts out of 758 LAUSD elementary and middle schools -- including all charter and magnet schools. In both subjects, the percentage of CWC Silver Lake students testing at or above grade level increased from the previous year. 

Prior to August 2019, CWC Silver Lake was spread across three different campuses. With Red Hook’s partnership, they have now built a brand-new school building to house 650 students in grades TK-5. The second phase of development is in progress with plans to install solar paneling and develop an outdoor play space.

Nearly every CWC school has a waiting list, and thus CWC is working to open additional schools in new locations. CWC is building the first national school network committed to racial and socio-economic diversity, and Red Hook is proud to be part of that success.
